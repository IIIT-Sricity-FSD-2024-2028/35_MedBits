# Patient Appointment and Registration Management System
## Problem Statement
The existing systems suffer from inadequate coordination between patients, doctors and front-desk staffs, leading to delays and miscommunication.
Doctor consultations and follow-up visits are inefficient due to manual processes and the lack of online medicine and lab test services increases paperwork and reduces overall efficiency.

### Proposed Solution
- Online appointment booking and walk-in appointment management to streamline patient handling.
- Doctor consultations and follow-up visits are automated for better efficiency.
- Online medicine purchase and lab test booking reduces paperwork.

## System Overview
- Patients can register their personal details and book appointments with doctors through the portal.
- Front-desk staff handle patient registration, manage walk-in entries and schedule or update appointments.
- Doctors conduct consultations, review patient details and generate digital prescriptions.
